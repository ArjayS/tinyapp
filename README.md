# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Hi! to whoever is visiting, This version of TinyApp was made by Robert Servado and I have added small paragraph to boost my confidence in taking ownership in creating this app, as mentioned by my evaluator. I am currently making my TinyApp Dryer but I am slowly getting there. Thank you to all the mentors and instructors who have made me reach this far from the program!
